OTSE-ELUST
==========

**otse-elust** is an extremely simple filemanager for serving static files through Google App Engine. 

This app provides a upload interface to store and serve files and was initially developed for [otseelust.com](http://www.otseelust.com).

NB
----

In the App authentication options allow users only from a specific domain OR update app.yaml to allow only admin logins (change *login: required* to *login: admin*).
